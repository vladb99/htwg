<p>I participated in two different online CTF events, namely "Capture The Flag 2021" organized by the University of Applied Sciences of Eastern Switzerland and "Secureburg's CTF" organized by the Swedish company SecureBug AB.</p>
<p>"Capture The Flag 2021" took place on 11 Nov 21 and consisted of three rounds, each lasting two hours. The challenge categories were social engineering, web security, network security, crypto, penetration testing and reverse engineering.</p>
<p>"Securebug's CTF" began on November 26 and ended on November 28. The categories were web, cryptography, forensics, miscellaneous, exploitation, reverse engineering and OSINT.</p>

<p>"Capture The Flag 2021" was my first CTF event that I participated in. During this event, I spent most of my time focusing on the challenges from the web categories, but I was unable to solve any of them. Although there were no writeups on these challenges, I was still able to learn quite a bit and learn about the tools and methods used to solve web challenges. Also, I was only able to solve one task from the exploitation category during the event.</p>
<p>During Securebug's CTF, I solved two web challenges. One actually during the event and the other during the writing phase. I almost solved the latter in the allotted time, but my time just ran out at the end.</p>

<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" href="#user-content-its-all-relative" id="user-content-its-all-relative" name="user-content-its-all-relative"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>It's all Relative</h4>
<p>The challenge from the "exploitation" category was called "It's all Relative" and you could connect to a provided server. The goal was to gain access to a file called "flag.txt" where the flag was stored. The problem was that this file was located in the root directory and therefore could not be accessed without the necessary permissions. The challenge also provided an executable file that could output the flag to the console if the user had the necessary rights. This "right" to read the flag was stored in a file called "flag-reader.txt", which had the content "no". To be able to read the flag, the content of this file should be set to "true". It is important to know that this file could also not be modified, but only read.</p>
<p>This executable had the problem that it called "flag-reader.txt" by a relative path and not by an absolute path. So I came up with the solution of creating another file called "flag-reader.txt" with the contents "true" in a location that I had access to, and then running the executable from that location.</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-c"><pre>./../../bin/flag-reader</pre></div>
<p>This would cause the executable to use the file I created rather than the file in the bin folder. By executing this file, I got the flag:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-c"><pre>HLCR{1t<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>s_411_r314t1ve...}</span></pre></div>

<p>This challenge comes from the Securebug CTF from the Web category. To solve it, you had to apply some PHP tricks on a website. When the website is opened, the following code is displayed:</p>
<p>![[Screen Shot 2021-12-18 at 16.05.10.png]]</p>
<p>To get the flag, you need to find two strings (a and b) that are not the same, but both have the same sha1 and md5 value. At first I tried to find a so-called collision where two different strings have the same sha1 value, but I quickly realized that it would be very difficult to find a collision that has both the same sha1 and the same md5 value.</p>
<p>After some research (especially <a href="https://medium.com/@mena.meseha/php-functions-security-issues-755ce4c8643c" rel="nofollow">https://medium.com/@mena.meseha/php-functions-security-issues-755ce4c8643c</a>) I found out that the sha1 and md5 method returns NULL if it can't handle an argument. The trick was to pass two arrays to trick the code. So I made a POST request using Postman with the following payload:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-c"><pre>https:<span class="pl-c"><span class="pl-c">//</span>ch5.sbug.se/?a[]=a&amp;b[]=b</span></pre></div>
<p>This returned me the flag:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-c"><pre>SBCTF{g07_2_w17h_0n3_SH07?}</pre></div>

<p>This challenge also comes from the Securebug CTF from the Web category. Again, PHP code had to be exploited to get the flag.</p>
